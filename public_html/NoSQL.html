        <h1>NoSQL</h1>
                    <ul><li>NoSQL stands for Not Only.  This terminology can be used to refer to a variety of different database technologies <ul>
                                <li>Key-value pairs</li>  
                                <li>Graph-based databases, which specialise in representing and handling problems from graph theory</li>
                                <li>Document databases which are used for analysing documents and other texts</li>
                                <li>Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which are used for geographic analysis</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>These types of databases are often specialised for particular functions</li>
            <li>These technologies are more complementary technologies to relational databases rather than replacement technologies</li>
            <li>SQL and the underlying relational database technology increasingly support functionality similar to NoSQL Databases</li>
                    </ul>
        <h2>Key-value pairs</h2>
        <ul><li>Key-value pairs are where the columns of data can vary between rows and the columns can contain lists of things</li>
                    <li>Key-value pair databases provide excellent performance in a web environment for managing data about online sessions</li>
                    <li>Key Value databases are often used on a website in conjuction with data warehouses that support more structured information</li>
        </ul>
