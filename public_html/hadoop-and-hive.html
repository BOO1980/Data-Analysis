        <h1>Hadoop</h1>
        <ul><li>Hadoop is one of the technologies highly associated with big data</li>
            <li>Hadoop is conjuction with MapReduce</li>
            <li>Hadoop is an open-source project and the code is available for free online</li>
            <li>The goal of Hadoop is to have a framework for reliable, scalable, distributed computing</li>
            <li>Hadoop is a platform for processing humongous amounts of data</li>
            <li>Hadoop particularly processes data from sources such as web logs, high energy physics, high volumes of streaming images and other voluminous data sources</li>
            <li>Google developed a parallel framework around MapReduce, and now its a framework for programming data intense tasks on large grid computers</li>
            <li>Hadoop actually has a family of technologies and MapReduce is only one application</li>
            <li>Hadoop have other tools with colourful names such as <ul>
                    <li>Hive</li>
                    <li>Mahout</li>
                    <li>Cassandra</li>
                    <li>Pig</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Although the underlying technology is different from relational databases there are similarities in the problems these technologies are trying to solve</li>
            <li>Hadoop languages are based on SQL syntax.  Such as CQL</li>
            <li>Hive in particular is being developed into fully functional SQL engine and can run many queries</li>
        </ul>
